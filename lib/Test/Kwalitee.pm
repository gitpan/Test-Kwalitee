=head1 NAME

Test::Kwalitee - test the Kwalitee of a distribution before you release it

=head1 VERSION

version 1.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in a separate test file
  use Test::More;

  eval { require Test::Kwalitee; Test::Kwalitee->import() };

  plan( skip_all => 'Test::Kwalitee not installed; skipping' ) if $@;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kwalitee is an automatically-measurable gauge of how good your software is.
That's very different from quality, which a computer really can't measure in a
general sense.  (If you can, you've solved a hard problem in computer science.)

In the world of the CPAN, the CPANTS project (CPAN Testing Service; also a
funny acronym on its own) measures Kwalitee with several metrics.  If you plan
to release a distribution to the CPAN -- or even within your own organization
-- testing its Kwalitee before creating a release can help you improve your
quality as well.

C<Test::Kwalitee> and a short test file will do this for you automatically.

=head1 USAGE

Create a test file as shown in the synopsis.  Run it.  It will run all of the
potential Kwalitee tests on the current distribution, if possible.  If any
fail, it will report those as regular diagnostics.

If you ship this test and a user does not have C<Test::Kwalitee> installed,
nothing bad will happen.

To run only a handful of tests, pass their names to the module's C<import()>
method:

  eval
  {
      require Test::Kwalitee;
      Test::Kwalitee->import( tests => [ qw( use_strict has_tests ) ] );
  };

To disable a test, pass its name with a leading minus (C<->) to C<import()>:

  eval
  {
      require Test::Kwalitee;
      Test::Kwalitee->import( tests =>
          [ qw( -has_test_pod -has_test_pod_coverage ) ]
      );
  };

As of version 1.00, the tests include:
